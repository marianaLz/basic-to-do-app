## About
This is a basic to do app made with React that interacts with an API made with Express. The API is a simple CRUD. Functions include registering, logging in, logging out, creating tasks, editing tasks, deleting tasks and viewing tasks.

## ¡Go to the app!
You can try the app [here](https://basic-to-do-app.herokuapp.com).



I have created a user who already has some tasks, you can access with this account:

	username: mariana password: mariana

You can also register and create your own tasks ;)
